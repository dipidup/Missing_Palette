        <p class="legal-note">This page consolidates our Terms of Use, Refund &amp; Cancellation policy, Copyright &amp; Trademark policy, DMCA notice, Privacy pointers and other legal terms. It is intended to be read in full for legal clarity.</p>

        <!-- 1. TERMS -->
        <h2 id="terms">1. Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>

        <p><strong>Scope.</strong> These Terms govern your access to and use of Missing Palette (the “Website”), and any purchases, commissions, workshops or services provided by Missing Palette (the “Services”). By accessing the Website or purchasing Services you agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <ul class="legal-list">
            <li><strong>“Website”</strong> refers to missingpalette.com and affiliated pages controlled by Missing Palette.</li>
            <li><strong>“Services”</strong> include custom paintings, prints, workshops, classes, digital downloads and consulting offered by Missing Palette.</li>
            <li><strong>“You”</strong> or <strong>“User”</strong> means an individual visitor, customer, or purchaser who uses the Website or Services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User obligations</h3>
        <p>When interacting with the Website and Services you agree to: provide accurate information for orders and registrations; not impersonate others; not attempt unauthorized access or disrupt the Website; not upload unlawful or infringing content to our channels.</p>

        <h3>Accounts &amp; Security</h3>
        <p>For certain Services you may be asked to create an account or provide contact and billing details. You are responsible for keeping account credentials secure and for all activity under your account.</p>

        <h3>Service changes</h3>
        <p>Missing Palette reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Website or Services at any time without prior notice. Prices, descriptions and availability of Services can be changed at our discretion.</p>

        <!-- 2. ORDERS, PAYMENTS -->
        <h2 id="purchase">2. Orders, Pricing &amp; Payment</h2>

        <h3>Order confirmation</h3>
        <p>When you place an order you will receive an order confirmation email. That confirmation is not an acceptance of the order. Acceptance occurs when we confirm the order and receive cleared payment (or when physical goods are shipped).</p>

        <h3>Pricing and taxes</h3>
        <p>Prices displayed on the Website are in the stated currency and may change. Applicable taxes, duties or shipping fees are added at checkout and are the responsibility of the purchaser. For international shipping customs, import duties and local taxes are the purchaser’s responsibility.</p>

        <h3>Payment processing</h3>
        <p>Payments are processed through third-party payment gateways. Missing Palette does not store full card details. We use secure payment providers — refer to their terms and privacy policies for payment-specific issues.</p>

        <h3>Non-payment &amp; fraud</h3>
        <p>If fraudulent activity is suspected or payment fails, Missing Palette reserves the right to cancel orders and communicate with your bank or payment provider to resolve the matter.</p>

        <!-- 3. SHIPPING & DELIVERY -->
        <h2 id="delivery">3. Shipping, Delivery &amp; Risk</h2>

        <h3>Shipping methods</h3>
        <p>Physical artworks and prints are shipped via couriers. Estimated delivery times are provided but not guaranteed; delivery may be delayed by customs, carrier issues or force majeure events.</p>

        <h3>Risk and title transfer</h3>
        <p>Risk of loss passes to you once the artwork is handed to the shipping carrier. Title transfers when payment has been received in full by Missing Palette.</p>

        <h3>Inspection & damaged goods</h3>
        <p>Inspect deliveries immediately. For damaged or incorrect items, keep packaging and photograph the damage. Notify Missing Palette within 24 hours of receipt with photos and tracking information to claim replacement, repair or refund at our discretion.</p>

        <!-- 4. REFUNDS & CANCELLATION -->
        <h2 id="refunds">4. Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy</h2>

        <h3>Custom commissions</h3>
        <p>Commissions require a non-refundable deposit to confirm booking and begin work. Once work starts, deposits and progress payments are non-refundable. Changes may incur additional fees depending on scope.</p>

        <h3>Workshops and events</h3>
        <p>Workshop bookings are subject to specific terms posted at signup. Generally, tickets are non-refundable. Rescheduling may be permitted up to 48 hours before the event subject to availability.</p>

        <h3>Original artwork and prints</h3>
        <p>Sales of original artwork are final unless explicitly stated. For prints or delivered goods, refunds may be issued for defective or incorrectly described items if reported within 7 days of delivery, provided proof is supplied.</p>

        <h3>Digital goods</h3>
        <p>Digital downloads and files are generally non-refundable once access is granted.</p>
